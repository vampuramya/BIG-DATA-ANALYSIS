##YOU HAVE TO ENTER DESCRIPTION  OF YOUR TASK In this task, USE IN GOOGLE COLAB Free cloud environment.
Easily integrates with PySpark.
No need for local setup. I used PySpark on Google Colab to perform big data analysis on a large dataset containing over 50,000 rows. The data was processed using Spark DataFrame API. I performed descriptive statistics, filtering, grouping, and calculated average values to derive insights. This demonstrated how PySpark can efficiently handle and analyze big data in a scalable manner.
